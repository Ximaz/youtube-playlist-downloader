# Frontend

The frontend is kind of my weakness, I do not really like that, but I tried my
best, and got it working. Sorry for frontend engineers.

It does not really use anything else than Nuxt-ish packages to be fair.

## Setup

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) to manage packages.

It is designed to run using the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) runtime.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

In order to run this project, you first need to install the dependencies :

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development server

To start the development server, you can type this command :

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The server will be reachable on `http://localhost:4000`.

### Production server

To start the production server, you can type those commands :

```bash
# Build the server using Nuxt :
pnpm build

# (Optional) Locally preview production build :
pnpm preview

# Once satisfied, start the server :
pnpm start
```
